Project Overview
The portfolio website is a dynamic platform designed to showcase the following:

Personal Introduction: A brief description of who you are, your background, and your expertise.
Projects: A gallery of your most notable projects, with detailed descriptions, tech stacks, and links to live demos or repositories.
Skills & Technologies: A section listing your technical skills, with animated progress bars or counters to visually represent your proficiency.
Contact: A contact form or social media links for visitors to get in touch.
The website features smooth transitions between pages and interactive animations for hover effects, page loading, and navigation. Using GSAP, the animations are responsive and optimized for performance. Three.js is integrated to add 3D effects, such as dynamic backgrounds or interactive visuals, making the site feel cutting-edge.

Technologies Used
HTML5: Structure and content of the website.
CSS3: Styling and layout of the website, including animations and transitions.
GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): A powerful library for creating high-performance, complex animations (e.g., smooth transitions, element movements, and effects).
Three.js: A JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics, enabling dynamic, interactive visual elements.
JavaScript: For interactivity, such as form submissions and user interactions with animations.
Git: Version control for tracking and managing changes in the project.
GitHub Pages (Optional): To host the portfolio website directly on GitHub.
Future Enhancements
Responsive Design: Ensure the website is fully responsive on mobile devices and tablets for better user experience.
Blog Section: Add a blog page to share thoughts, insights, or tutorials.
Dynamic Theme: Implement a dark/light mode toggle for users to customize their experience.
Animations on Scroll: Introduce scroll-based animations, where elements animate into view as the user scrolls.
SEO Optimization: Improve the site's SEO for better visibility on search engines.
Accessibility Enhancements: Ensure the website is fully accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility).
Advanced 3D Interactions: Enhance the Three.js integration with more interactive 3D models or animations.
Version Control
This project uses Git for version control, enabling easy tracking of changes and collaboration if needed. The project will be hosted on GitHub to ensure that the latest version of the website is always available and can be shared with others. Every update to the portfolio will be tracked with commits to ensure progress is saved, and the site is continuously improved.
